## Summary
The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

## Skills: 
data cleaning, data analysis, DAX, Creating Measure, and data visualization.

# Technology: POWER BI.

## GOAL 
To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

## Results:
Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.
